# Saltani

## docs

saltani/docs contains the bulk of the material - documentation for Saltani laid out in
a numbered series of files.

01_pronunciation.md explains how to pronounce and write the language. This makes it
totally optional, because the rest of the series is not concerned with sounds and their
representation.

The remaining files are intended to be read in order, because each section builds on
the previous material. However, there are cross-references throughout, and any section
should be relatively clear without having read everything before it.

## scripts
saltani/scripts contains several python scripts I have written that do something related
to Saltani, along with their supporting data files. It also contains a half-written lua
script intended to hook into rainmeter.

vocabquiz.py is the only script likely to be interesting or regularly useful, but the
others are included for the sake of completeness.
