# 03. Pronouns and modifiers

## 1. Personal pronouns

As seen in sections 02.1.2. and 02.2.2. on basic word order, subjects and objects are
usually omitted if they are pronouns. The marking on the verb carries the same
information, making free-standing pronouns redundant.

However, there are full forms of all the pronouns, as seen in the table below, which can
be used for emphasis.

| | first person singular | first person plural | second person |
|---|---|---|---|
| ```agentive``` | ```kiveng``` | ```kileng``` | ```tsubeng``` |
| ```patientive``` | ```ki``` | ```kilha``` | ```tso``` |
| ```focus``` | ```kis``` | ```kils``` | ```tsus``` |

| | third person animate | third person inanimate | third person conceptual |
|---|---|---|---|
| ```agentive``` | ```nglaiweng``` | ```tileng``` | ```kaiyeng``` |
| ```patientive``` | ```ngla``` | ```til``` | ```hai``` |
| ```focus``` | ```nglais``` | ```tilis``` | ```kais``` |

These pronouns appear in the same place in the sentence as the noun they replace.

| | | | | |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ```kais``` | ```notangachai``` | | ```tso``` | ```ntsiuse``` |
| ```3C;FOC``` | ```see:3A>3C``` | | ```2``` | ```sleep:2``` |
| ```she sees IT``` | | | ```YOU sleep``` | |

## 2. Basic modifiers

### 2.1. Adjectives

#### 2.1.1 Adjective formation

Adjectives are generally formed in one of two ways. The first is with the suffix
```-o```, which makes adjectives from nouns.

| | | |
|---|---|---|
| ```kleis-o``` | ```kabte-o``` | ```letso-o``` |
| ```ruler-ADJ``` | ```snow-ADJ``` | ```cat-ADJ``` |
| ```royal/noble``` | ```snowy``` | ```feline``` |

(Note that the last is pronounced with a glottal stop as indicated in section 01.3.1.
on epenthesis - ```lEtso?o``` instead of ```lEtso:```.

The second is with ```-(a)r``` and ```-(a)d```, which form the ergative and absolutive
participles respectively and make nouns/adjectives from verbs. The optional ```a```
on each is used if and only if the verb ends in a consonant. ([Ergative and
absolutive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergative%E2%80%93absolutive_language) mean
that subjects of transitive verbs are ergative, while their objects along with
subjects of intransitive verbs are absolutive.)

| | | |
|---|---|---|
| ```rubra-d``` | ```rekun-ar``` | ```rekun-ad``` |
| ```be.loud-AP``` | ```love-EP``` | ```love-AP``` |
| ```loud (one)``` | ```lover/loving one``` | ```beloved (one)``` |

#### 2.1.2 Adjective placement

Participle adjectives almost always come after the nouns they modify, unless they are
made from verbs with incorporated nouns (see section TODO on noun incorporation).

| | | | |
|---|---|---|---|
| ```ombuo``` | ```silsi-d``` | ```karsta``` | ```nyera-r``` |
| ```horse``` | ```run-AP``` | ```rope``` | ```enclose-EP``` |
| ```running horse``` | | ```looped/wound rope``` | |

Adjective of the ```-o``` kind almost always come before the nouns they modify.
(Exceptions can be made on the basis of pragmatics, poetic effect, or similar.)

| | | | |
|---|---|---|---|
| ```aklen-o``` | ```tuen``` | ```choika-o``` | ```lhiava``` |
| ```dog-ADJ``` | ```person``` | ```flower-ADJ``` | ```cloth``` |
| ```loyal person``` | | ```flower-patterned cloth``` | |

### 2.2. Numbers

The basic cardinal numbers are as follows.

| | | | | |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ```la``` | ```fi``` | ```askaa``` | ```kini``` | ```esa``` |
| ```zero``` | ```one``` | ```two``` | ```three``` | ```four``` |
| | | | | |
| ```naka``` | ```kau``` | ```lisa``` | ```yate``` | ```ablu``` |
| ```five``` | ```six``` | ```seven``` | ```eight``` | ```nine``` |

For the ways of forming higher numbers, see section TODO on number formation.

Cardinal numbers appear before the
