# 03. Pronouns and modifiers

## 1. Personal pronouns

As seen in sections 02.1.2. and 02.2.2. on basic word order, subjects and objects are
usually omitted if they are pronouns. The marking on the verb carries the same
information, making free-standing pronouns redundant.

However, there are full forms of all the pronouns, as seen in the table below, which can
be used for emphasis.

| | first person singular | first person plural | second person |
|---|---|---|---|
| ```agentive``` | ```kiveng``` | ```kileng``` | ```tsubeng``` |
| ```patientive``` | ```ki``` | ```kilha``` | ```tso``` |
| ```focus``` | ```kis``` | ```kils``` | ```tsus``` |

| | third person animate | third person inanimate | third person conceptual |
|---|---|---|---|
| ```agentive``` | ```nglaiweng``` | ```tileng``` | ```kaiyeng``` |
| ```patientive``` | ```ngla``` | ```til``` | ```hai``` |
| ```focus``` | ```nglais``` | ```tilis``` | ```kais``` |

These pronouns appear in the same place in the sentence as the noun they replace.

| | | | | |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ```kais``` | ```notangachai``` | | ```tso``` | ```ntsiuse``` |
| ```3C;FOC``` | ```see:3A>3C``` | | ```2``` | ```sleep:2``` |
| ```she sees IT``` | | | ```YOU sleep``` | |
