# 02. Basic sentences

The basic grammatical distinction is between subject and object - nominative and
accusative "cases" or roles. The actual case _marking_ is slightly different, but
these are the underlying roles.

## 1. Subjects

### 1.1 Verb marking for subjects

Verbs that have subjects are marked with the appropriate suffix for the subject,
as seen in the table below. (Some verbs do not have subjects - see section TODO
on avalent verbs.) The optional ```a``` on each is used if and only if the verb ends
in a consonant.

| first person singular | first person plural | second person |
|---|---|---|
| ```-(a)ya``` | ```-(a)lya``` | ```-(a)se``` |
| ```1SG``` | ```1PL``` | ```2``` |
| ```I``` | ```we``` | ```you/y'all``` |

| third person animate | third person inanimate | third person conceptual |
|---|---|---|
| ```-(a)ng``` | ```-(a)di``` | ```-(a)re``` |
| ```3A``` | ```3I``` | ```3C``` |
| ```he/she/they``` | ```it/they``` | ```it/they``` |

### 1.2. Intransitive verbs

If the subject is a noun, it comes before the verb as seen below.

| | | | | |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ```bitrova``` | ```ketidi``` | | ```ngityu``` | ```lhuchang``` |
| ```table``` | ```fall:3I``` | | ```bird``` | ```be.careful:3A``` |
| ```the table falls``` | | | ```the bird is careful``` | |

If the subject is a pronoun, it is usually omitted as seen below.

| | |
|---|---|
| ```mutuhalya``` | ```aiorung``` |
| ```be.small:1PL``` | ```have.energy:3A``` |
| ```we are small``` | ```she has energy``` |

### 1.3. Subject marking for agentive and patientive case

The subjects above are all unmarked because they are in the patientive case. This is
used for subjects that are not active (like the ones above.)

Subjects can also be active, in which case (hah) they get marked with the agentive
case. This means they are suffixed with ```'(i)n``` (but see section 03.2.1.3 on
adjectives disrupting this pattern, as well as section TODO on possessives). The
optional ```i``` is used if and only if the noun ends in a consonant.

| | | | | |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ```utma'n``` | ```iotong``` | | ```aklen'an``` | ```wiyufang``` |
| ```servant=AG``` | ```dance:3A``` | | ```dog=AG``` | ```speak:3A``` |
| ```the servant dances``` | | | ```the dog speaks``` | |

## 2. Objects

### 2.1. Verb marking for objects

Verbs that have objects are marked with the appropriate suffix for the object (after
the subject suffix), as seen in the table below. The optional ```a``` on each is
used if and only if the verb ends in a consonant.

| first person singular | first person plural | second person |
|---|---|---|
| ```-(a)ki``` | ```-(a)lki``` | ```-(a)dse``` |
| ```1SG``` | ```1PL``` | ```2``` |
| ```me``` | ```us``` | ```you/y'all``` |

| third person animate | third person inanimate | third person conceptual |
|---|---|---|
| ```-(a)n``` | ```-(a)l``` | ```-(a)chai``` |
| ```3A``` | ```3I``` | ```3C``` |
| ```him/her/them``` | ```it/them``` | ```it/them``` |

### 2.2. Transitive verbs

If the object is a noun, it comes before the verb and after the subject (if any is
stated explicitly) as seen below.

| | | |
|---|---|---|
| ```letso'n``` | ```lhiava``` | ```kunsingal``` |
| ```cat=AG``` | ```cloth``` | ```bite:3A>3I``` |
| ```the cat bites the cloth``` | | |
| | | |
|```ngityu'n``` | ```wiihuti``` | ```lingakangan``` |
| ```bird=AG``` | ```squirrel``` | ```touch:3A>3A ``` |
| ```the bird touches the squirrel``` | | |

If the object is a pronoun, it is usually omitted as seen below.

| | | |
|---|---|---|
| ```ektotasel``` | ```aaihuti'n``` | ```ngudrangaki``` |
| ```break:2>3I``` | ```squirrel``` | ```fight:3A>1PL``` |
| ```you break it``` | ```the squirrel fights me``` | |

### 2.3. Object marking for patientive and focus case

The objects above are all unmarked because they are in the patientive case. This is
used for objects that are physically affected (like the ones above.)

Objects can also be unaffected, whereupon they get marked with the focus case. This
means they are suffixed with ```'(i)s``` (but see section 03.2.1.3 on adjectives
disrupting this pattern, as well as section TODO on possessives). The optional ```i``` 
is used if and only if the noun ends in a consonant.

| | | | | | |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ```satera``` | ```tsiwi's``` | ```weranadal``` | | ```oastar'is``` | ```uostayachai``` |
| ```shoe``` | ```house=FOC``` | ```be.beside:3I>3I``` | | ```voice=FOC``` | ```hear:1SG>3C``` |
| ```the shoe is beside the house``` | | | | ```I hear the voice``` | | |
