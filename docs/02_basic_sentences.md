# Basic sentences

## Verb marking for subjects

Verbs that have subjects are marked with the appropriate suffix for the subject,
as seen in the table below. (Some verbs do not have subjects - see section TODO
on avalent verbs.) The optional ```a``` on each is used if and only if the verb ends
in a consonant.

| first person singular | first person plural | second person |
|-|-|-|
| ```-(a)ya``` | ```-(a)lya``` | ```-(a)se``` |
| ```1SG``` | ```1PL``` | ```2``` |
| ```I``` | ```we``` | ```you/y'all``` |

| third person animate | third person inanimate | third person conceptual |
|-|-|-|
| ```-(a)ng``` | ```-(a)di``` | ```-(a)re``` |
| ```3A``` | ```3I``` | ```3C``` |
| ```he/she/they``` | ```it/they``` | ```it/they``` |

## Intransitive verbs

If the subject is a noun, it comes before the verb as seen below.

| | | | | |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| ```bitrova``` | ```ketidi``` | | ```ngityu``` | ```lhuchang``` |
| ```table``` | ```fall-3I``` | | ```bird``` | ```be.careful-3A``` |
| ```the table falls``` | | | ```the bird is careful``` | |

If the subject is a pronoun, it is usually omitted as seen below.

| | |
|-|-|
| ```mutuhalya``` | ```aiorung``` |
| ```be.small-1PL``` | ```have.energy-3A``` |
| ```we are small``` | ```they have energy``` |

## Subject marking for agentive and patientive case

The nouns above are all unmarked because they are in the patientive case. This is used
for subjects that are not active (like the ones above.)

Subjects can also be active, in which case (hah) they get marked with the agentive
case. This means they are suffixed with ```'(a)v``` (but see section TODO on clitic
behavior). The optional ```a``` is used if and only if the noun ends in a consonant.

| | | | | |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| ```utma'v``` | ```iotong``` | | ```aklen'av``` | ```wiyufang``` |
| ```servant=AG``` | ```dance-3A``` | | ```dog=AG``` | ```speak-3A``` |
| ```the servant dances``` | | | ```the dog speaks``` | |

## Verb marking for objects

Verbs that have objects are marked with the appropriate suffix for the object (after
the subject suffix), as seen in the table below. The optional ```a``` on each is
used if and only if the verb ends in a consonant.

| first person singular | first person plural | second person |
|-|-|-|
| ```-(a)ki``` | ```-(a)lki``` | ```-(a)dse``` |
| ```1SG``` | ```1PL``` | ```2``` |
| ```me``` | ```us``` | ```you/y'all``` |

| third person animate | third person inanimate | third person conceptual |
|-|-|-|
| ```-(a)n``` | ```-(a)l``` | ```-(a)chai``` |
| ```3A``` | ```3I``` | ```3C``` |
| ```him/her/them``` | ```it/them``` | ```it/them``` |
