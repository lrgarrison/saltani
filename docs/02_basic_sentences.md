# Basic sentences

## Intransitive verbs

An intransitive verb has only a subject, no object. It is marked with the appropriate
suffix for the subject, as seen in the table below. The optional ```a``` on each is
used if and only if the verb ends in a consonant.

| first person singular | first person plural | second person |
|-|-|-|
| ```-(a)ya``` | ```-(a)lya``` | ```-(ase)``` |
| ```1SG``` | ```1PL``` | ```2``` |
| ```I``` | ```we``` | ```you/y'all``` |

| third person animate | third person inanimate | third person conceptual |
|-|-|-|
| ```-(a)ng``` | ```-(a)di``` | ```-(a)re``` |
| ```3A``` | ```3I``` | ```3C``` |
| ```he/she/they``` | ```it/they``` | ```it/they``` |

If the subject is a noun, it comes before the verb as seen below.
