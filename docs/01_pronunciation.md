# Pronunciation

## 1. Phonetic inventory - what sounds does it have?

Phonemes appear as below.

> p, b

First comes the romanization (way of writing the sound), each in square brackets.
Then comes the [X-SAMPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-SAMPA) transcription
of the realizations (different pronunciations of "the same" sound), separated by
commas. (Where there is more than one realization, see section TODO on allophony.)
