# Pronunciation

## 1. Phonetic inventory - what sounds does it have?

Phonemes appear as below.

> [sy] [ch]
> s\, z\

The first line is all possible romanizations (ways of writing the sound),
each in square brackets. The second line is the [X-SAMPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-SAMPA)
transcription of the realizations (different pronunciations of "the same" sound),
separated by commas. (Where there is more than one realization, see section TODO on
allophony.)

A vowel is written doubled or with an acute accent to indicate that it is stressed in
a nonstandard way (see section TODO on stress.)
