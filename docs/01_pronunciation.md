# Pronunciation

## 1. Phonemes and orthography - what are the sounds and how are they written?

Phoneme examples appear as below.

```[b] p, b```

First comes the romanization (way of writing the sound), each in square brackets.
Then comes the [X-SAMPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-SAMPA) transcription
of the realizations (different pronunciations of "the same" sound), separated by
commas. (Where there is more than one realization, there are no rules at this time
for which is used in what contexts.)

### 1.1. Vowels

```[a] a```

```[e] E```

```[i] i```

```[o] o```

```[u] u```

A vowel is written doubled or with an acute accent to indicate that it is stressed in
a nonstandard way (see section this.4.1. on stress.)

### 1.2. Consonants

| | Velar | Palatal | Alveolar central | Alveolar lateral | Labial |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| stop | ```[k] k,g``` | ```[ty] c``` | ```[t], [d] t, d``` | | ```[b] p, b``` |
| flap | | | ```[r] 4``` | ```[tl]``` | |
| fricative | ```[h] x, G``` | ```[ch] S``` | ```[s] s, z``` | ```[lh] K, K\ ``` | ```[v] f, v``` |
| nasal | ```[ng] N``` | ```[ny] J``` | ```[n] n``` | | ```[m] m``` |
| approximant | ```[y] j``` | ```[ly] L``` | | ```[l] l``` | ```[w] w``` |

## 2. Phonotactics - how do the sounds go together?

The general syllable structure is ```(C)(C)V(C)```, where ```(C)``` represents a
consonant and ```V``` represents a vowel.

Nasals that come immediate before an obstruent (stop or fricative) must be homorganic
(at the same [place of articulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Place_of_articulation).)

Adjacent phonemes must differ from each other - that is, there are no long vowels or
[geminated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemination) consonants. (When two of the
same phoneme adjoin at word boundaries, see section this.3.1. on epenthesis. When they
adjoin at morpheme boundaries in the middle of a word, see section this.3.2. on
deletion.)

## 3. Morphophonology - when words happen, how does that affect the sounds?

Pronunciation examples appear as below.

| |
|-|
|```baika```|
|```paiga```|

First comes the word as it is written. Then comes the
[X-SAMPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-SAMPA) transcription.

### 3.1. Epenthesis

When two of the same phoneme adjoin at word borders, [epenthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epenthesis)
occurs.

If two of the same vowel adjoin, the added sound is a glottal stop ```?``` to the
beginning of the second word.

| | | | | |
|-|-|-|-|-|
|```baika```|```abtiku```|```-->```|```baika```|```abtiku```|
|```paiga```|```aptigu```|```-->```|```paiga```|```?aptigu```|

For consonants, ```a``` is added as a new final syllable to the first word. Note the
syllable boundaries (indicated by periods) moving in ```iang```, and see section this.4.2.
on syllable-timing for an explanation.
| | | | | |
|-|-|-|-|-|
|```iang```|```ngestu```|```-->```|```iang```|```ngestu```|
|```i.a.N```|```NEs.tu```|```-->```|```i.a.Na```|```NEs.tu```|

### 3.2. Deletion

When two of the same phoneme adjoin at morpheme borders in the middle of a word,
[deletion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elision) occurs. That is, the word is
pronounced as is there were only one of the doubled phoneme, because there are no
long vowels or geminated consonants. Some deletions are reflected in the way the
word is written, because the new word is an established compound (like the first
example below.) Some are not, because they are nonce combinations (like the second
below.)

Note the syllable boundaries (indicated by periods ```.```) moving in ```viruh```, and
see section this.4.2. on syllable-timing for an explanation.

| | | | |
|-|-|-|-|
|```virukh```|```ha```|```-->```|```viruha```|
|```fi.4ux```|```xa```|```-->```|```fi.4u.Ga```|
| | | | |
|```nisli```|```ibvami```|```-->```|```nisli-ibvami```|
|```nis.li```|```i.bva.mi```|```-->```|```nis.li.bva.mi```|

## 4. Prosody

Pronunciation examples appear as below.

| |
|-|
|```koauru```|
|```koa"u4u```|

First comes the word as it is written. Then comes the
[X-SAMPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-SAMPA) transcription.

### 4.1. Stress

The primary stress of a word falls on its penultimate syllable (except for
monosyllables, which may or may not be stressed depending on grammatical function.)
If the primary stress of a word does not follow this rule, the orthographic rule
in section this.1.1. applies.

Note that primary stress is indicated by a double-quote ```"```.

| | | |
|-|-|-|
|```lu```|```koauru```|```uulinu```|
|```"lu```|```koa"u4u```|```"ulinu```|

When morphemes are combined into words, the "head" morpheme retains its primary stress
and the "dependent" morpheme receives secondary stress. (Since the meanings of the
words are irrelevant here, trust that the first morpheme in each example is the head.)

Note that secondary stress is indicated by a percent sign ```%```.

| | | | |
|-|-|-|-|
|```bvai```|```silsi```|```-->```|```bvai-silsi```|
|```"pfai```|```"silsi```|```-->```|```"pfai%zilsi```|
| | | | |
|```letso```|```yinya```|```-->```|```letsu-yinya```|
|```"lEdzu```|```"jinja```|```-->```|```"lEdzu%jinja```|

### 4.2. Timing and syllabification

Saltani is syllable-timed, meaning that each syllable occupies about the same amount
of time. The syllables are divided as follows:

* Vowels with no onset (preceding consonant) are syllables whether or not they have
codas (following consonants.)
* Single consonants sandwiched between vowels are the onsets of the following
syllables.
* Consonants at the ends of words are syllable codas.
* Two consonants sandwiched between vowels are split, so that the first is the
coda of the previous syllable and the second is the onset of the following syllable.
